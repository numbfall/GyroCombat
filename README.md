Bullets raving on the screen

To prevent you from being the human auto fire, only 4 bullets/player can be on the screen at the same time.

If the fight gets too tough, ‘ESC’ to pause. ‘DEL ’brings you back to the main menu. Press delete again to quit the game.

### Collisions 
| Collision type &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Results |
| --- | --- |
| Player - Player | If one or each of the players exceed the maximum collision velocity (MCV), the result is a death. |
| Player - Ground | If you exceed the MCV you will explode. Collisions less than MCV will cause the chopper to bounce back. The MCV is about the speed the chopper reaches in a free fall from a height of three blocks, starting from zero velocity. |
| Bullet - Player | KAPOW! |
| Bullet - Ground | The bullet vanishes and you can fire again. |

### Fuel

No, choppers do not run with oxygen or ozone. The fuel is decreased all the time and you have to refuel every now and then. Refueling is initiated by landing slowly on the landing zone (you'll know what's a LZ when you see one ;). The fuel bar increases rapidly, and when you're full, off to the battle it is!

If you run out of fuel mid-flight, you lose the vertical controls.

Now you sit ducks and wait for the other player to come and finish you off, or in case the other player also lost altitude and can’t reach you, you – imaginatively – explode.

### Power-ups
| Type | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Shield | Gives you an extra life, meaning your drops score will not increase after death. |
| Fuel | Restores your fuel. |
| Haste | Gives you maximum movement speed in all directions, be careful with the collisions though. |
| Ammo | Gives you 8 rounds per screen as opposed to 4 and increases the fire speed to maximum. |

### Who's the winner?

The winner is the one who last remains airborne out of ten drops. Drops are increased every time your player dies.
